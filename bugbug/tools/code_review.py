{patch}

1. Understand the changes done in the patch by reasoning about the summarization as previously reported.
2. Identify possible code snippets that might result in possible bugs, major readability regressions, and similar concerns.
3. Reason about each identified problem to make sure they are valid. Have in mind, your review must be consistent with the source code in Firefox. As valid comments, not related to the patch under analysis now, consider some below:
[
    {{
        "file": "com/br/main/Pressure.java",
        "code_line": 458,
        "comment" : "In the third code block, you are using `nsAutoStringN<256>` instead of `nsString`. This is a good change as `nsAutoStringN<256>` is more efficient for small strings. However, you should ensure that the size of `tempString` does not exceed 256 characters, as `nsAutoStringN<256>` has a fixed size."
    }},
    {{
        "file": "com/pt/main/atp/Texture.cpp",
        "code_line": 620,
        "comment" : "The `filterAAR` function inside `#updateAllowAllRequestRules()` is created every time the method is called. Consider defining this function outside of the method to avoid unnecessary function creation."
    }},
    {{
        "file": "drs/control/Statistics.cpp",
        "code_line": 25,
        "comment" : "The condition in the `if` statement is a bit complex and could be simplified for better readability. Consider extracting `!Components.isSuccessCode(status) && blockList.includes(ChromeUtils.getXPCOMErrorName(status))` into a separate function with a descriptive name, such as `isBlockedError`."
    }}
]
4. Filter out comments that focuses on documentation, comments, error handling, tests, and confirmation whether objects, methods and files exist or not.
5. Final answer: Write down the comments and report them using the JSON format previously adopted for the valid comment examples."""

PROMPT_TEMPLATE_FILTERING_ANALYSIS = """Please, double check the code review provided for the patch below.
Just report the comments that are:
- applicable for the patch;
- consistent with the source code in Firefox;
- focusing on reporting possible bugs, major readability regressions, or similar concerns.

Do not change the contents of the comments and the report format.
Adopt the template below:
[
    {{
        "file": "com/br/main/Pressure.java",
        "code_line": 458,
        "comment" : "In the third code block, you are using `nsAutoStringN<256>` instead of `nsString`. This is a good change as `nsAutoStringN<256>` is more efficient for small strings.

Review:
{review}

Patch:
{patch}

As examples of not expected comments, not related to the current patch, please, check some below:
    - Please note that these are minor improvements and the overall quality of the patch is good. The documentation is being expanded in a clear and structured way, which will likely be beneficial for future development.
    - Please note that these are just suggestions and the code might work perfectly fine as it is. It's always a good idea to test all changes thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.
    - Overall, the patch seems to be well implemented with no major concerns. The developers have made a conscious decision to align with Chrome's behavior, and the reasoning is well documented.
    - There are no complex code changes in this patch, so there's no potential for major readability regressions or bugs introduced by the changes.
    - The `focus(...)` method is called without checking if the element and its associated parameters exist or not. It would be better to check if the element exists before calling the `focus()` method to avoid potential errors.
    - It's not clear if the `SearchService.sys.mjs` file exists or not. If it doesn't exist, this could cause an error. Please ensure that the file path is correct."""
