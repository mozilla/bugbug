I just managed to reproduce yet another time by simply updating Firefox from 58 something to 59.0.1 over an RD session to a Windows 7 machine without abandoning the session during the process - when it relaunched itself after the update it was invisible.\n\nIn my experience it only happens when launching the first instance of Firefox (without any Firefox processes already running), and I would say it happens much more often on Windows 7.\n\nOnce you get out of the problem and manage to see a properly sized Firefox window, it's not going to happen again for some time.\n\nI don't think I've seen it happening even once on Windows 10, then again, I usually log out of the RD sessions to my Windows 10 PC and usually keep the RD session to the Windows 7 PC running. So it would appear that the problem has a much bigger chance to happen if Firefox is launched from under a long running RD session, regardless of when it was abandoned.\n\nFrom the user point of view, it is very unclear how to get out of this situation when it happens, because Firefox appears on the taskbar as running but there is no visible window (it's located at [0,0] and has zero size). You have to shift-click the Firefox taskbar button to show the old-style window menu, then select Move and then move the window out of [0,0] with the keyboard, which will also resize it to its minimum possible size, then you can resize it more with the mouse.", "author": "gserg.g@gmail.com", "id": 13142648, "time": "2018-03-20T14:52:06Z"}, {"text": "Just happened to me on the fresh Windows 10 April update to which I was connected via remote desktop, and the RD session was brand new as well (i.e. not long running).\n\nI clicked to update Firefox to version 60, it restarted, and the Welcome page that opens after that was zero sized and in the top left corner.", "author": "gserg.g@gmail.com", "id": 13266581, "time": "2018-05-09T20:25:07Z"}], "id": 1405674, "priority": "P3", "cc": ["gserg.g@gmail.com", "jfkthame@gmail.com", "kanru@kanru.info", "mcastelluccio@mozilla.com", "milaninbugzilla@gmail.com"], "cf_crash_signature": "", "version": "56 Branch", "is_cc_accessible": true, "cf_tracking_firefox_esr52": "---", "see_also": [], "cf_tracking_thunderbird_esr60": "---", "cf_platform_rel": "---", "product": "Core", "cf_fx_iteration": "---", "blocks": [], "qa_contact": "", "creation_time": "2017-10-04T14:05:49Z", "cf_status_firefox_esr52": "---", "component": "DOM", "assigned_to_detail": {"email": "nobody@mozilla.org", "id": 1, "name": "nobody@mozilla.org", "real_name": "Nobody;
