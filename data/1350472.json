One thing I think we should focus on is breaking huge modules into two parts (at least). (1) stub that attaches some dummy observers and listeners, and load the rest of the stuff only when needed (2) the heavy part that we instantiate only at the first event or whatever it triggers it. The good thing is that once we have this pattern, we can start looking into unloading the heavy bits once they are no longer needed and just keep the dummy listeners.

It could (and should) just use other URLs for that, they don't need to be about: URLs at all, I think. Per bug 1236755 they shouldn't be chrome URLs, but resource: URLs should be unprivileged enough for what we want here, maybe/hopefully?\n\nAlso, I vaguely recall there's now code to just open a tab to do sign-up, so maybe the sign-up flow could be switched to that entirely, and we can stop using a frame for the 'saved' bits, and then we can forget about this whole sorry saga.\n\n>Telemetry: ???\n\n>  resource://gre/modules/DeferredTask.jsm\nThis I would expect other places to use, too, but maybe other consumers use lazy module getters?\n\n>  resource://gre/modules/debug.js (only imported from Telemetry)\nYuck. A \"jsm\" which has a .js extension and has only 1 function in it? It looks like only TelemetrySession requires it from telemetry, might be simplest to just shift those consumers to something else. It seems we use it more extensively in the parent process, though I'm unconvinced it's really all that useful.\n\nAnother option would be moving it to AppConstants or Services.jsm and also ifdef'ing it into a no-op on release builds (which is what it currently checks at runtime, which seems particularly unhappy from a perf perspective).\n\n\n>  resource://gre/modules/Log.jsm (only imported from Telemetry)\n>  resource://gre/modules/PromiseUtils.jsm (only imported from Telemetry)\nThese 2 are also surprising to me in that I'd expect other things to use them.\n\n>  resource://gre/modules/ServiceRequest.jsm from resource://gre/modules/TelemetrySend.jsm:26\n>  resource://gre/modules/TelemetryController.jsm\n>  resource://gre/modules/TelemetrySend.jsm\n>  resource://gre/modules/TelemetrySession.jsm\n>  resource://gre/modules/TelemetryTimestamps.jsm\n>  resource://gre/modules/TelemetryUtils.jsm\n\nI'm fairly sure not all of these should be necessary in the content processes. Folks in #telemetry will know more.\n\n>Spell checker: ???\n>  resource://gre/modules/InlineSpellCheckerContent.jsm from chrome://browser/content/content.js:16\n>  resource://gre/modules/InlineSpellChecker.jsm from chrome://browser/content/content.js:15\n>  resource://gre/modules/InlineSpellChecker.jsm from resource://gre/modules/InlineSpellCheckerContent.jsm:11\nThis looks like an easy fix - we should only need these once you context-click on a spellcheckable area. We can remove the InlineSpellChecker.jsm import from content.js and make the other import lazy.\n\n>Probably not easily fixable: (mostly things that need to analyze each page as it loads)\n>  resource://gre/modules/ReaderMode.jsm\nI wonder if we could make this more lightweight, though. We could potentially factor out the 'isprobablyreaderable' stuff instead of loading the entire jsm and whatever it depends on, until the user actually activates reader mode.\n\n>  resource:///modules/ContentLinkHandler.jsm\nIf it gains us something significant, it looks like the event listeners for meta elements could live in the main content process script (the result of the content-observers change), and be attached/removed when globals are created (for which there are observer notifications, I think).\n\n>  resource:///modules/Feeds.jsm\nAll the message listeners are for the parent process, I think, so only isValidFeed is really needed in the content process, so we could maybe move that elsewhere. That also cuts out the useless event listeners. isValidFeed is only called from content.js, so we could just move it there or to ContentLinkHandler.jsm if we keep that.\n\n>  resource:///modules/FormSubmitObserver.jsm\n\nThis is already a dep of this bug for this, bug 1250487. I think we could lazily import it after the first invalidformsubmit observer notification, which are pretty rare, so might be worth doing - that or just stick the entire thing in the process script.\n\n>Generic utilities probably not worth looking into:\n>  AppConstants.jsm, BrowserUtils.jsm, Console.jsm, Preferences.jsm,\n>  PrivateBrowsingUtils.jsm, Promise.jsm, Task.jsm, Timer.jsm\n\nMoving to async/await should get rid of Promise.jsm and Task.jsm. I actually am not a big fan of Preferences.jsm but I don't know that there's consensus on that. Now that the pref service itself supports default values I think it's lost some of its usefulness. Console.jsm should ideally be lazy-getter'd from everywhere. I don't think we log stuff to it as a general rule except in, well, exceptional situations, so maybe that'll help.
