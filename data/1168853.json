The rpc function needs direct access to the  worker debugger's postMessage API, because its protocol operates on a level below that of normal debugger packets. In addition to rpc calls, this worker debugger protocol is used to connect to the worker debugger, and multiplex messages from different connections over a single channel.\n\nWe don't want ordinary modules to have unrestricted access to the worker debugger API. For this reason, we do not expose the postMessage API to modules. The only place where it can be accessed directly is in the bootstrap script, which handles all messages for the worker debugger protocol.\n\nThis is the main reason I've defined the rpc method in the bootstrap script, and exposed it as a built-in global, instead of a standalone module. I agree that the latter probably would have been cleaner, so if you can think of a way to do this without exposing the postMessage API to every module, let me know!\n\nOn the server side, since the worker rpc server is always the WorkerDebuggerServer, I think it makes sense to have the rpc logic there, as we do now. It doesn't actually require any state, so having an initializeWorkerRpcServer function feels like an unnecessary abstraction.\n\n> ::: toolkit/devtools/DevToolsUtils.js\n> @@ +584,5 @@\n> > +    // issuing an rpc request, to fetch the URL on our behalf.\n> > +    exports.fetch = function (url, options) {\n> > +      return rpc(\"fetch\", url, options);\n> > +    }\n> > +  })();\n> \n> Why the immediately invoked function here and in the if's consequent branch?\n> They both look superfluous to me: am I missing something?\n> \n\nIt doesn't seem actually necessary here, so I could get rid of it if you'd like.
