This especially affects Linux distributions which ship all of their localizations as langpacks, but also affects many other users who install langpacks themselves.\n[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Yes.\n[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: Not yet.\n[Needs manual test from QE? If yes, steps to reproduce]: Described in earlier comments.\n[List of other uplifts needed for the feature/fix]: None.\n\n[Is the change risky?]: Low-risk.\n[Why is the change risky/not risky?]: This makes a minor change to the way that we register resource: substitutions so that mixed-case substitution names are always treated as lower-case. Since lookups are always lower-cased in order to support the requirement that hostnames are case-insensitive, mixed-case substitutions were entirely inaccessible prior to this patch, so there are no existing valid use cases we can break. The only possible risk is if we were previously registering a mixed-case substitution which would conflict with an all-lower-case substitution.
