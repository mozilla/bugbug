But it seems to be a problem showing up\nin different environments... So I would say it is a bug in usrsctp. However,\nthe data pointer SHOULD NOT be NULL when the chunk is in the send queue. It\nMAY be null, if the chunk is in the sent queue.\nPlease note that there is a know bug (we are working on it) when you use the\nbuffer priority policy, but this is NOT used within WebRTC.\nSo if you find a place where the pointer is set to NULL for a chunk being\nin the send queue and not using the buffer priority policy, I would like to\nknow, since might be the root cause.\n\nI have not seen this bug in my testing...\n> \n> > Does FF provide some API how we can get some additional information when\n> > this problem occurs?\n> \n>    I am not aware of any Firefox API that would give you more info when a\n> third-party library crashes than what you get already with crash-stats.\nOK.
