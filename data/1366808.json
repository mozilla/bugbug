The child process apparently sends its build ID over in an IPC message on startup, and the parent process does this assertion:\nhttps://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/2b7d42d527af582a465e49187fe387442d524a7c/ipc/glue/MessageChannel.cpp#1046\n\nForking seems fraught with peril given all the existing Gecko threads in the parent process, and the sandboxing setup we do for child processes, but we did have a similar feature for B2G where we would preload child processes by forking.

If we restarted a crashed tab, we would hit the parent crash. That would probably also be true for launching media/plugin processes which both get spawned on-demand.

Chrome may be able to get away with it because it is installed in a per-user location (if I recall correctly). I'm going to expand the current checks for pending updates in our startup code to also check for currently running Firefox processes (only for the path that we're trying to update). We may be able to get away with postponing updates. Or we could notify the user of the pending update and offer the option to forcibly shut down existing Firefox processes.

From a user's persective, this typically happens when a new tab is opened. When a user runs into this situation, there isn't anything to display as content in the tab. If we display the doorhanger, and especially if we allow the user to dismiss the doorhanger with \"Not Now\", the user would be left with a blank tab. Any further new tabs will equally display a blank page and basically lead to a broken experience until the browser is restarted. Only existing tabs will continue to work.

Your tab has crashed.\" scenario, which is why the chrome page was suggested.", "author": "spohl.mozilla.bugs@gmail.com", "id": 13147197, "time": "2018-03-21T23:05:31Z"}, {"text": "I didn\u2019t know that failing to take action will lead to a broken experience.

You must receive review from a data steward peer on your responses to these questions before shipping new data collection.\n\n1. What questions will you answer with this data?\n\nThis data is to maintain the ability to detect the frequency of buildID mismatches between parent and child processes. The frequency of these mismatches could previously only be analyzed via crash stats on Socorro. Telemetry is a better and more appropriate way of gathering/analyzing this data.\n\n2. Why does Mozilla need to answer these questions? Are there benefits for users? Do we need this information to address product or business requirements?\n\nWe need to know the frequency of buildID mismatches occurring in the wild. Once this bug (bug 1366808) lands, we will start displaying an error page. Currently, this is believed to be a sufficient remedy because it is believed that the frequency of these mismatches is small. Should the frequency turn out to be higher than expected, we may have to invest additional resources to find different technical remedies.\n\n3. What alternative methods did you consider to answer these questions? Why were they not sufficient?\n\nThe only other method was the previous method via crash stats in Socorro, which isn't an appropriate way of gathering/analyzing this data.\n\n4. Can current instrumentation answer these questions?\n\nNo (there are no existing telemetry probes that can be used to answer this question).\n\n5. List all proposed measurements and indicate the category of data collection for each measurement, using the Firefox data collection categories on the Mozilla wiki.\n\nMeasurement Description: Frequency of buildID mismatches\nData Collection Category: Category 1\nTracking Bug #: Bug 1366808\n\n6. How long will this data be collected? Choose one of the following:\n\nI want to permanently monitor this data, as changes to installers/updaters may change the frequency of buildID mismatches.\n\n7. What populations will you measure?\n\nAll\n\n8. If this data collection is default on, what is the opt-out mechanism for users?\n\nDefault opt-out mechanism for opt-out telemetry probes.\n\n9. Please provide a general description of how you will analyze this data.\n\nThis telemetry probe maintains the ability to detect the frequency of buildID mismatches between parent and child processes that was provided by Socorro and crash reports before. Interested parties can analyze this data using dashboards etc.\n\n10. Where do you intend to share the results of your analysis?\n\nInternally, to guide decisions about allocation of engineering resources to develop additional remedies.", "author": "spohl.mozilla.bugs@gmail.com", "id": 13219202, "time": "2018-04-19T17:43:37Z"}, {"text": "Created attachment 8969360\n3.
