I think this is about state invalidation and fallbacks.\n\nHere's the original block from the website in Comment #0:\n\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" id=\"SampleMediaPlayback\" name=\"SampleMediaPlayback\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\">\n  <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://stream.rotaxowner.com/swfs/SampleMediaPlayback.swf\">\n  <param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\">\n  <param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#f3f3f3\">\n  <param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\">\n  <param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"&amp;src=https://stream.rotaxowner.com/vod/loctite.f4m&amp;autoHideControlBar=true&amp;streamType=vod&amp;autoPlay=true&amp;verbose=true\">\n  <embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" bgcolor=\"#000000\" flashvars=\"&amp;src=https://stream.rotaxowner.com/vod/loctite.f4m&amp;autoHideControlBar=true&amp;streamType=vod&amp;autoPlay=true&amp;verbose=true\" id=\"SampleMediaPlayback\" name=\"SampleMediaPlayback\" pluginspage=\"http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer\" quality=\"high\" src=\"https://stream.rotaxowner.com/swfs/SampleMediaPlayback.swf\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\">\n</object>\n\nWith the original applet patch, I removed classid checking, which did 2 things:\n\n- Truncate MIME type\n- Set state to invalid\n\nThe truncation of MIME type had no bearing on this and was redundant anyways, as that would happen in the state invalidation block later too (https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/base/nsObjectLoadingContent.cpp#1795). \n\nHowever, since the object tag in the above example has a classid, if we invalidate state on the presence of classid, we invalidate the object tag and look at the child tags. In this case, the embed tag works. If I pull the embed node of the object node and place it as a child of the enclosing div, the movie comes up in nightly (v61).\n\nWhen I removed classid checking as part of applet tag removal, the state invalidation no longer happened, meaning for some reason we handled things correctly on the first load, but after first load, the object tag was seen as valid, but since it doesn't have the flash variables in either its own attributes and we apparently ignore the param tags, the movie doesn't load.\n\nThings I'm still not sure of and need to research more:\n\n- Why the first load works but subsequent loads don't/Why we don't always fall back to the embed tag\n- Why we aren't parsing param tags (they show up as disabled in devtools inspector, at least)\n- What the HTML spec says we're supposed to do in this case\n\nBasically just need to figure out what behavior conforms to spec expectations.", "author": "kyle@nonpolynomial.com", "id": 13250222, "time": "2018-05-02T19:17:27Z"}, {"text": "Oh, yeah.
