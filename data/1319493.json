I had already thought of that, but shied away for reasons of time...\nBut after all, I couldn't resist... but it took hours to get everything right...\nSo yes, it's implemented.\n\n> Also shouldn't we note in AB delete dialog that all containing contacts will\n> be deleted too? This should be to prevent data loss.\n\nDone. Short and simple.\n\nIn anticipation of your next question, and looking at the file deletion prompt on Windows 10, I also included the number of selected items in the message text. So when you intend to delete two, but accidentally select three, at least you can't blame Thunderbird because we'll tell you EXACTLY what you're about to do... (ux-error-prevention).\n\nHaving \"Multiple\" in the titles for multiple selected items like \"Delete Multiple Contacts\" is also an active contribution to ux-error-prevention, so that the titles of single vs. multiple items become more distinguishable. Windows 10 also has that, and it definitely makes sense.\n\nSo this works perfectly according to specs, and smarter than ever, so I'm expecting big smiles from Richard...\n\nJ\u00f6rg, if you could kindly check the code for correctness. It's enough if this code does what it should. We're not here for perfection, and I'm not willing to spend more time on purely cosmetical changes.

But I would make it \"Are you sure you want to delete the contact\n> \"#1\"?\"\n\nNo. Three reasons to keep the item name on a separate line:\n1) Salience. Hiding it in the sentence makes the name stand out less, but the name is really what matters most. The sentence is actually just a more verbose repetition of the title, so it's not really important. But it's important, and should be as easy as possible to parse/check visually, which exact item name will get deleted. Windows Explorer also does it exactly like that, and they certainly have their reasons.\n2) Unknown item name length. The length of the name is totally unknown to us. At the end, you can neither read the name properly (because it's somewhere in the sentence), nor the sentence (because the name is disturbing, worse when it might be in middle position in other languages, like \"Are you sure deleting 'Active customers address book archive 2016-August' is what you want?).\n3) Avoiding grammatical oddness in other languages. Embedding the unmodified item name into the sentence is easy for languages like English and German, but maybe not for every language. \"Are you sure you want to delete 'itemName'\" requires item name to be in object case or whatever way the language uses for objects, but we don't have item names in object case, we just have item names. Depending on the language, this might sound really odd if rules for objects are not correctly followed.\n\n> > > confirmDeleteContacts=Are you sure that you want to delete this #1 contact?;Are you sure you want to delete these #1 contacts?\n> > \n> > This is a plural form so we need to use semicolon separated list of plural\n> > forms.\n> > I maintain that this form is inherently plural-only, we'll never use any\n> > form of this for num=1.

Icelander looks at first slot, there's no #1 placeholder, so you end up having first slot in icelandic without placeholder.

The word \"or\" must never appear in this string, so putting it in the template imo has a high risk of causing wrong translations which just pick up the \"or\" because they don't know which item combinations we really check for. Iow, they can't know that we only put contact *or* mailing list here but it can never occur in the product. So they can feel obliged to translate this for their first slots exactly as we offer them. So I think the choice is really between blank slot, random placeholder, or 2a), correct grammar but will never be used for EN, which they may not know.\nWe want them to fill all of their slots, so I think filling ours with 2a) is wise.\n\n> I think we already had a case like this in another bug and we just filled in\n> the singular form for English correctly.\n\nBut there is no singular form used in the product here, and it's impossible to fill singular because \"contacts and mailing lists\" is already plural, so the only way to make it singular is OR but I have already argued against that.\n\n> Also, we have strings that do not contain the #1 placeholder (do not show\n> the number of items).\n> E.g. in messenger.properties: markFolderRead=Mark Folder Read;Mark Folders\n> Read\n> \n> In this case translators also need to be clever and fill in all their forms,\n> but in a neutral way not knowing how many contacts there are.\n> So e.g. in my language where we have 3 forms (num=1,num=2-4,num>4) the\n> translator puts the strings identical for form 2 and 3, which wouldn't be\n> the case if the num was shown in a placeholder.

Like Icelandic, where all numbers ending in one (except 11, mind you!) have the same form, so in a way they are using the singular form for things which are plural in the English concept...:\n\"1, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91, 101, ...\"\nIt seems to follow from that that even talking of a singular form will be an alien concept for such languages, because there's no special form for num=1 only.\n\n> What stops you doing:\n\nAceman's comment 15 :p\n\n> confirmDeleteContact=\n> Are you sure you want to delete this contact?\\n\\n#1;\n> Are you sure you want to delete these #1 contacts?\n> You can use different inserts if you're worried about #1 having different\n> meanings.\n\nNo, the worry is Icelandic: They need to fill their first slot including the number of items, because it applies to 1, 21, 31, 41, etc., most of which we consider plural.\nSo offering them an English model where the first slot does not even have that number-of-items placeholder can certainly lead to confusion.\nAlso, Aceman reported that the forms might actually be different again when there's no explicit number. So having the #1 placeholder for number-of-items or not does seem to make a big difference.\n\nUltimately, we decided that the best example we can give is just to fill our slots with the correct forms which normally go into our slots (slot1: num=1/singular, slot2: num>1/plural), so that other languages will also be inspired to fill all of their own slots correctly according to their distribution patterns:\nIcelandic: slot1: num=1,21,31,41 etc.(singular/certain plural, anything ending in 1, except 11), slot 2: num= 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, (anything else, nothing/certain plural)\n\n> Looking at the strings, you have these new ones:\n> 1) confirmDeleteThisContact, confirmDelete2orMoreContacts\n> 2) confirmRemoveThisContact, confirmRemove2orMoreContacts\n> 3) confirmDeleteThisMailingList, confirmDelete2orMoreMailingLists\n> 4) confirmDelete2orMoreContactsAndLists\n> I'd combine the two items in 1) to 3) into one item to avoid unused singular\n> forms.\n> \n> I think Aceman asked to make the unused singular part singular, but that\n> hasn't happened here:\n> confirmDelete2orMoreContactsAndLists=\n> Are you sure you want to delete these #1 contacts and mailing lists?;\n> Are you sure you want to delete these #1 contacts and mailing lists?\n\nI explained that in my comment 28, search for: \"conscience\".\nThis is the EN singular slot for a form which is always inherently plural and can never be singular in the English concept of things (1 contact and 1 mailing list is the smallest possible combination here, that makes 2 items), so we can't fill this differently without breaking our own grammar completely. Broken grammar isn't a good role model.\n\n> So, combine items 1) to 3) into one string. If there are really pressing\n> reasons why you can't do/don't want to do that, I'm sure you will point me\n> to the comment where that's been discussed. In this case, unused strings\n> should be marked unused.\n\n\"unused\" is arguably a bad role model for other languages who need to fill all of their slots, so an empty slot can confuse them to do the same in their language, which can come out very wrong for Icelandic & Co.\n\n> Clearing the review for now.\n\nBtw, Aceman already cleared the strings part with his r+, and only asked you to review the code part ;)\nYou are welcome to read the entire discussion and development above, but otherwise let's avoid going in circles so that we can get done with this!\n\nYes, Pluralforms are mind-warping when it comes to radically different language concepts...\nMy personal favorite is Plural rule #16 (Celtic/Breton) with as many as 6 different forms for very wild conglomerates of numbers with unpredictable exceptions...\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Localization/Localization_and_Plurals#Plural_rule_.2316_.283_forms.29\n\nIt's another good example that even where we think that we know it all and our view of things must be \"right\" and we can even give reasons to justify our view, someone else can look at the same the thing from a totally different perspective, which actually makes the same thing look radically different to the extent of *being* radically different.
