Comment 7 makes more sense to me now.  I assume you are saying\nthe centering happens within the content box (inside the border and padding)\nrather than within the border box.\n\nPerhaps though for elements using box-sizing: border-box [1]\nthe centering should be within the border box.  I'm not entirely sure.\nMaybe it depends on whether the height is explicit or intrinsic.\n[1] https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing\n\nPerhaps elements that specify the height should not be natively styled?\n\n> The clipping of content within the border bounds as seen with\n> > data:text/html,<input style=\"height: 15px\" value=\"Help\">\n> will need to be addressed before this can work though, I think.\n\nAh, yes.  That is an issue here.\n\nFor input, that may be related to using \"overflow-clip-box: content-box;\"\nand the anonymous div using overflow-y:auto.\nDOM inspector View menu lets you \"Show Anonymous Content\".  The built-in\nInspector can also do that by setting a pref in about:config.\n\nselect doesn't have an anonymous div but uses overflow-clip-box: padding-box.\n\n> Would we\n> just subtract the necessary height to center from the border widths in\n> layout, I suppose?\n\nSounds reasonable.\n\nIdeally I guess we should be distinguishing between border and padding in the\nwidget code.  Perhaps we can do that for selects?  They don't specify\npadding, which was the problem with doing that for inputs.\n\nThe height of separators in moz_gtk_combo_box_paint() might need some\nrethinking if the padding can be changed by content.", "author": "karlt@mozbugz.karlt.net", "id": 11026794, "time": "2015-12-23T01:27:44Z"}, {"text": "Regression and direct impact on websites, tracking!", "author": "sledru@mozilla.com", "id": 11087000, "time": "2016-01-19T12:58:13Z"}, {"text": "(In reply to David Baron [:dbaron] \u231a\ufe0fUTC+13 from comment #6)\n> Centering seems like the right thing, and seems like we should get that done\n> sooner rather than later.\n> \n> Any chance jwatt could look at this?\n\nNot likely in the next few weeks. :( I have a lot of other things to catch up or just now.
