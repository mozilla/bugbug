And for a \"simple web browser\", Firefox is fairly unique in what it asks for, so it is quite normal for it to be the only application (in any volume) to trigger a particular driver issue.\nThen there are the times when Firefox does something wrong, but gets away with it for a while, until an updated drivers closes the door, and the bug is triggered.\nIt is still important for us to figure out when something started and if it's particular to a driver or an OS update.  Not to blame and walk away, but to get more information about how to fix it.  If the problem is on \"active\" driver branch and hardware, the fix is often coming, but if it's something old, chances are Firefox will have to work around it anyway.

I have 2 machines (same spec Win7x64, GTX1060 and drivers). One can reproduce the issue, the other cannot. The only difference is I had to replace one of my monitors  - a 27\" 4k monitor. Since replacing it, the machine with the new monitor has been encountering these TDRs while browsing. I've tested both HDMI and DP connectors. The only fix I've had is to disable both HW accel and AL on that machine.\n\nI do need to try turning HW accel back on since I only disabled AL after encountering yet another crash after disabling HW accel. With both disabled, there definitely has been no TDRs for me over the past 3 months.", "author": "lunyee@gmail.com", "id": 13128313, "time": "2018-03-14T16:48:53Z"}, {"text": "If HW accel is disabled, AL can't be enabled (it's a specific HW accel).", "author": "poubelle06210@live.fr", "id": 13128663, "time": "2018-03-14T18:41:33Z"}, {"text": "(In reply to mooms from comment #174)\n> If HW accel is disabled, AL can't be enabled (it's a specific HW accel).\n\nI don't know what to say.
