If the user has a saved password on an HTTP page, the Password Manager should not fill it automatically.  Instead, the user should have to first type in or select their username.  At that point (after user interaction) the Password Manager can fill the password.\n\nGiven bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1179961 has landed, Firefox will be sending mixed messages if we both warn the user that the password could be compromised and fill it in for them.  Hence, it's time to finally stop autofilling passwords on HTTP pages!\n\n+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1118511 +++\n\nWhen passwords are autofilled by the Password Manager, javascript on the page can read the filled in passwords even when the user has no intent to login to the page.  Hence, pages that are vulnerable to javascript injection (via XSS or MITM) are also subject to password exfiltration attacks[1] (in some cases without any indication to the user that such an attack has taken place).  To protect against this, we should not autofill passwords without user interaction / user intent to login.  This protects users from a number of the drive by attacks and protects users who never planned to login.\n\nFrom a usability perspective, it is debatable whether or not autofill is a good user experience.  It allows for an easy and frictionless login, but can also cause confusion (how did my password get filled in?). Discussion about a more active login experience (rather than a passive one) are underway with UX.\n\nIf we do decide that we need to continue with an autofill experience, then there are cases where we definitely should not autofill.  (Note that this will make a less consistent experience for users and won't protect us on a page with an XSS vulnerability.)  In the below cases, we MUST not autofill:\n* For http sites (IE 11 has this security feature)\n* https sites that have mixed active content\n* https sites that require a cert override (chrome does this)\n* in iframed sites (safari does this for non-same origin, chrome does this for all frames).\n* Invisible form fields (visibility and opacity, although this isn't going to prevent clickjacking attacks to autofill the passwords)\n\nPrevious bugs have been filed to address subsets of this problem.

Are the preferences in discussion:\n> (a)\"security.insecure_field_warning.contextual.enabled\" and\n> (b)\"signon.autofillForms.http\"? Their defaults today (12.27) in Nightly53\n> are: (a) - false and (b)- true.\n> The defaults when this lands will be a-true and b -false as the title of\n> this issue suggests?\n\nYes, correct. See https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/f0d146fe7317\n\n> 2. I'm not sure what exactly you mean by the \"login manager autocomplete\n> changes\" - could you specify a list of (meta)bugs that cover this? Would\n> this also cover the email tread with the password autocomplete? guessing\n> this would be it bug 1318203?\n\nI mean refactorings like bug 1296638 and bug 1294502 (plus follow-ups) that this work built on top of. I would recommend getting ideas from the spreadsheet and I've added these two bugs there: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/155k3Ja06QVgRj9F_DnAJxC8wfH_lWM4N9eZal4llefk/edit#gid=1492590763\n\nYes, it's related to the firefox-dev thread about password autocomplete so anything related to autocomplete of usernames, passwords or even non-login data (e.g. using datalist or regular form history) were affected. \n\n> 3. I see that the tracking is set for 52/53, so I'll treat this work as a\n> bug verification work(exploratory testing and bug fix verification), but I'd\n> prefer if the time allows to treat it as a fully fledged feature (this means\n> test plan, test casing, etc). So, please let me know how are we faring on\n> the time chapter. Meanwhile, I'll go with the 1st version - bug verification\n> work(exploratory testing and bug fix verification).\n\nYeah, I think if you have time it would be good to treat it as a feature affecting autocomplete (and autofill on insecure pages). There are only a few more bugs to land and uplift in the spreadsheet so 52 is still attainable IMO.", "author": "MattN+bmo@mozilla.com", "id": 11951987, "time": "2017-01-02T23:01:02Z"}, {"text": "Comment on attachment 8821698\nBug1217152-12-23-16.patch\n\nApproval Request Comment\n[Feature/Bug causing the regression]: Insecure login field contextual warning feature\n[User impact if declined]: Users won't be warned in a login field when it's insecure\n[Is this code covered by automated tests?]: Yes, mochitests and unit tests\n[Has the fix been verified in Nightly?]: Adrian is working on verification. \n[Needs manual test from QE?
