I suspect the issue is similar to the tap to play on iOS/Android where you have to initiate play on the video element itself quickly. We had to put a workaround specifically for Android DASH to make that work. \n\nWhat we do when the user taps play by default is we create a Promise chain of about 3 or 4 different promises and then after they all resolve we call play on the actual video element itself. \n\nIn a typical scenario it looks a bit like this:\n\n- User clicks on play button\n- DASH manifest is loaded\n- MediaSource object is created, src on the video is set to a blob URL, appropriate event listeners are added\n- Preload segment is downloaded to approximate the user's bandwidth so we can choose a starting video quality\n- After that, the actual starting segment is downloaded and appended to the SourceBuffer\n- video.buffered range is checked to make sure we have enough to play after getting an \u201cappendbufferend\u201d event\n- Play is called on the video element itself", "author": "iamcraigcampbell@gmail.com", "id": 11545612, "time": "2016-07-13T16:37:11Z"}, {"text": "@iamcragicampbell:\n\nOver in bug 1277813 I'm making HTMLMediaElement.load() also capture the user intent to play. So if you call load() in the click handler itself on a video element, the video will be blessed and allowed to have playback invoked at a later stage via script.\n\nNote you can call load() on a video element without a src attribute or source children or MediaSource attached to capture user intent to play, and only later attach the MediaSource to *actually* load the video.

Some of the scores and reviews are incorrect (but that is inherent with most any review/scoring system).\n\nI installed it myself to test it.  First- you MUST turn on media.autoplay.enabled in config or that will override the addon!!  It gives a nice control icon/button, with menu.  It does seem to work.  By default, it disables autoplay on the sample sites I visited.  And there is a per-domain preference in the extension/addon config preference page.  When I told it to allow youtube.com, that ended up in a list and it remembered.  Conversely, it doesn't seem to interfere with playback on Spotify, like using media.autoplay.enabled=true does, even when I had NOT whitelisted Spotify.\n\nWhen it blocks playback, it has some of the similar issues we have seen with just using media.autoplay.enabled.  For example, on sites like cnn.com [yeesh] you have to play/pause/play to get it to play the video.  But because this can control things on a per-domain basis, it is FAR more powerful than media.autoplay.enabled.\n\nSo it seems like it is suitable replacement for the sorely missed \"Flashstopper\" addon.  Better because it has more controls and per-domain, yet still a little more flaky, but no worse than using media.autoplay.enabled.  Thank you very much for sharing the information about the Addon.  I am not sure how I/we missed this addon when searching in the past, it has been available since October 2016, perhaps because it doesn't say \"video\" anywhere.
