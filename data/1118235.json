I have no idea if that could cause this.\n\nAnother idea I have is that this slowdown isn't specific to Mac OS X, but also present on Linux/Windows, only we don't hit the case. The variance of the runs is very high. The avg on the affected system is 30ms (stable), but has a high variance. Some runs give 2ms, other 100ms. Also we don't see this regression on shell builds in Mac running Mac OS X.\n\n(In reply to Dan Gohman [:sunfish] from comment #19)\n> The penalty is documented to happen when transitioning between 256-bit AVX\n> instructions and legacy SSE instructions.
