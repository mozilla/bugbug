Yes, it is possible to run the GUI on MacOS X, however I haven't done it myself so can't give good instructions (there are some in https://github.com/mozilla/mozregression/blob/master/gui/README.rst though). Maybe best to let Yash work on this, since he's already started. \n\nIf you're looking for something to work on, I would welcome any patches to make the MacOS X version of mozregression easier to install for users (e.g. figure out how to generate a dmg that people can download and then self-install).

Thanks!\n\nHi Vedant, see bug 1425102. It turns out that this is a bit more involved than I thought to implement properly, probably involving porting mozregression (and some of its mozbase deps) to python 3.
