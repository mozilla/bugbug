I am running Mavericks, so of course my system font is Lucida Grande and the sidebar looks very different for me. The primary problem is interline spacing, although the font size also increased from FF 47 to 48. I don't see the point of comparing FF to Apple's Calendar/Contacts.

Two different font sizes, two different line spacings.  My eyes are bad now, and they never could easily read double spacing.  Having a large font next to a regular size font really makes it harder to quickly read/scan back and forth (I spend a lot of time in this editor), and likewise with the double spacing or lack of it.  Finally, the large font combined with the double spacing really squanders a lot of vertical space, significantly reducing the amount of information presented, making for my miserable user experience.\n\nI'm having a hard time imagining how a larger font and double spacing improves anyone's user experience.  To me, it just seems to make using bookmarks even more annoying than before, as has been the trend for almost a decade now.  But I'm happy to try to get along with opposing opinions.\n\nMy work, which will take me about 1-2 more years, is to make something even better than tags (which would be surprisingly useful if people would stop making tags more and more miserable to use) work.\n\nUnfortunately, I need what I currently can do with tags in order to organize both replace what I have in the new webextension regime, and to then produce this next version.\n\nFinally, just as a metric: the huge font and spacing makes it take about 2x longer for me to use that editor.  That's one hour per day to two hours per day.\n\nI am trying to fix it myself, but to do that, I need understand what the use cases are and be able to model those who like this new way more than the previous way.\n\nPS.

Having to refocus when bouncing back and forth a window of text is really slow and painful.  Not that I had special needs, the old standard setup worked just fine.  It's this \"let's frob one of many pieces and declare victory\" attitude that hurts me (every 3 months for 8 years).\n\nBeing a real person, I'm wondering why my accessibility needs are superseded by those of imaginary people who aren't even taken care of by this half measure (large fonts everywhere!).  I'd prefer coding to real people, and I don't have that data.\n\n> > I am trying to fix it myself, but to do that, I need understand what the use\n> > cases are and be able to model those who like this new way more than the\n> > previous way.\n> \n> I think in this bug the main aim is to make the font size and spacing in the\n> sidebar obey platform conventions / preferences.

How does something find it?\n\nI'm thinking ALL text should be resizable with a keyboard control, like command + and -.  Is there a problem with that method, which regretfully isn't supported everywhere?\n\nRecall that you changed normal font and spacing.  Not the other way around, and make it the only way.  I'm trying to do things in life (mathematics!), and having to make fixes to firefox full-time for the rest of my life really is distressing to me.\n\nBut yeah, I think going to firefox-dev makes sense.
