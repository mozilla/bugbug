The fix seems to be in 2017-04-06 (the bug exists in 2017-04-05). Mozregression was \"unable to find enough data to dissect\".\n\nI also noticed that switching, closing or opening a new tab with the Pen does not work intermittently in 2017-06-02 (and other builds, like 2017-08-02). This bug appears to me to be a different bug as moving the cursor does not trigger the intended behavior.\n\nWhile testing that, I once managed to trigger the bug from comment 4 when opening a link and switching tabs in quick succession (with build 2017-06-03, I think) when only a white page was shown until I moved the cursor. I also managed to trigger the original issue from this bug in 2018-01-22, 2018-03-23, 2018-04-17. The bisection eventually led me to changeset 2e462060cbedc258c3cfbb7aba14e22fd13cf854 / CommitID GDejDQE7sj3, which seems unlikely.\n\nIn those three recent nightly builds, a way to reproduce seems to be to open a link (e.g. with the twitter.com-tile on the new tab page) and directly after that, before even the tab title/icon changes, tapping on the \"new tab\" button, but that's hard to do. If the bug is triggered, switching or closing tabs does not work until the cursor is moved with the touchpad. The issue also does not occur every time, but is actually rather hard to reproduce for me (which might explain that I can't reproduce it after the 2018-04-17 build).\n\nTLDR: Original issue fixed between 2017-04-05/2017-04-06.
