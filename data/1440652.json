In the screenshots (both examples 1 and 2), the two systems are using entirely different fonts, which may well be a difference in system configurations rather than a Firefox issue.\n\nIn particular, in (1), the first image shows a font that has \"oldstyle\" numerals, while the second one has \"lining\" numerals. The \"oldstyle\" numerals are not misaligned, they are designed to be at different heights on the line.\n\nAnd in both cases, the fonts used are clearly different: this is particularly obvious in the design of some of the italic letters, such as \"f\", \"v\" and \"y\". Metrics difference between the fonts probably explain the apparent positioning difference of the \"Further reading\" heading. \n\nSo my question is whether this is simply a configuration difference between the systems (different default serif fonts? or the page style requests a specific font-family that is present on one system, but absent on the other?). Or are they truly identical configurations, yet Firefox is resolving fonts differently?
