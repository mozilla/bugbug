Basically, we push two patches to try - one in the \"ideal\" state (m-c), and one in the regressed state (your patch). The patches aren't empty though - they redirect try to run a special version of talos that dumps profiles after the talos run.\n\nOnce the try pushes have finished running the tpaint test a few times, we have some scripts that can extract the profiles from the talos logs. We can then create a comparison profile with both profiles to see what is uniquely expensive in the \"regressing\" patch.\n\nI'll push the patches to try to create the initial comparison profile for you to work off of. It's been a while since I've done one of these for ts_paint / tpaint, so it might take a few tries. I'll let you know when it's done.

But that's probably unrealistic, and we'll need to get a feeling for what looks acceptable, and what kinds of code changes are possible before quantifying goals.

As discussed via IRC, this change appeared to be necessary to allow for the fade-out of the arrows when the swipe completed.
