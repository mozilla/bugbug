I select the picture to upload, the picture will disappear immediately. The normal situation is to display the thumbnail of my uploaded picture in the window, then click to insert the article.\n\nI did a regression test and found that this problem is related to Bug 1382251.\n\nregression:\nhttps://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/json-pushes?changeset=d94c15bb443556229f6a433c4a3cf775fd342ada&full=1\nBug 1382251: Part 11 - Update moz.build with new files; r=jimm\nIncludes the build changes made by the earlier patches in this series.  Also adds some #includes required by other files when these are added to the unified build.\n\nplatform:\nIt works as normal on 32-bit Firefox, any version on Mac OS and Firefox 59. So I think it limited to Firefox 60 64-bits.\n\nSTR:\nThe websites with this issue are some Chinese forums. Because these forums usually use a template called discuz, this template still uses flash for uploading. Here I chose a digital forum as a demonstration.\n\n1.Visit http://www.dgtle.com/, click the '\u767b\u5f55(means login)' button in the upper right corner.\n2.Enter the account password and complete the following verification. This verification is to click on some Chinese characters in sequence.\n3.Login to return to the homepage, click on the '\u793e\u533a(means community)' above, you can see a post button(\u5199\u6587\u7ae0).\n4.In the editor, you can see a picture button means upload picture, click will let you select the local picture to upload. First activate the flash, select any local picture, then the window will show an upload progress bar, but nothing is displayed after the progress bar is completed. Thumbnail of uploaded picture should be displayed in normal.\n\nI uploaded a demo video of my operation(https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-bRYixnTQKcuH3YqvXPLR7Xn5xK-zcjj) and tried some websites that use this method to upload pictures (select the picture first, display the thumbnail, and click to insert article).

Several websites that had problems before were fixed. I think it's the same reason.\n\nThere are also users mentioned that when using uploadify to upload attachments, the upload has no problem and can be successful. However, when the callback function onUploadSuccess is executed, no parameters can be retrieved in the background, and data is empty. May also be due to this issue, I will try to contact him to test this package.", "author": "yxu@mozilla.com", "id": 13376393, "time": "2018-05-31T02:53:31Z"}, {"text": "Hi,\nI also encountered a problem when uploading attachments with flex. \nNormally, the page will list the uploaded file after upload file, but upload failed and nothing happened after select file when use FireFox 60.0.1, but this function works well in FireFox 59. \nI want to know if there is any possibility that the API for the upload file called by flash player is not supported in firefox 960.\nThanks.", "author": "dan-tao.cheng@hpe.com", "id": 13384475, "time": "2018-06-04T05:34:03Z"}, {"text": "That sounds like it is the same issue.
