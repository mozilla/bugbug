It happens when setting a breakpoint when there isn't a source.\n\nSeems like a frontend fix is needed to stop from trying to add a breakpoint in this case.

I think your patch still adds the breakpoint to the editor, but just doesn't do anything else. My patch adds the check a level higher, so the breakpoint isn't even added to the editor.
