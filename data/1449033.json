Several users reported that since Firefox 60 (dev and nightly version), Firefox periodically freezes for 1 to 2 seconds. I have reproduced with Firefox 61.\n\nAn easy way to reproduce is to install ZenHub (sorry, I haven't found a more straight forward way) and heads to a busy ZenHub board: https://github.com/saltstack/salt#boards?repos=122537149,18853426,1390248,6910286,12017151,47988358\n\nLaunch the performance profiler\n\nAnd start randomly scrolling vertically and horizontally like in this gif: http://www.giphy.com/gifs/3s8X6ZaStlUBSBl4Fk\n\nYou should get huge garbage collection periods like that: https://imgur.com/a/zjhlo\n\n\nHere's the description of the problem by one of our users: https://github.com/ZenHubIO/support/issues/1383#issuecomment-376321483\n\n\nActual results:\n\nGarbage collector runs for up to 2 seconds and freezes everything.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nIn Firefox 59 (the current latest release), everything works fine", "author": "savy.mathieu@gmail.com", "id": 13157251, "time": "2018-03-26T22:12:07Z"}, {"text": "User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.13; rv:61.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/61.0\nBuild ID: 20180330100123\n\nI have tested this issue on latest Nightly build and latest Fx release build using Mac OS X 10.13.3.

If that's not the case (sometimes the problem doesn't show), open a new tab with `https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki` wait a few seconds, and launch the performance tool again.\n\nI ran some experiments with the extension:\n- If I remove the call to our main() function inside the content script, the garbage collector still goes crazy. Therefore, I think we can exclude that it is not the code ran by the extension that triggers those garbage collection.\n\n- Removing `require()` calls in order to reduce the size of the final javascript file makes the garbage collection periods smaller.

I'm glad we can get some more confidence that the patch worked.\n\nI looked at these results, and I guess I should have clarified a bit: it is okay if the total CC times for a particular process  are above 100ms sometimes. Sometimes the CC has to do some work, like if you close a tab and we're cleaning it up, or the page discarded a bunch of data. This won't always clean up everything immediately, so it is normal to see even 2 or 3 in a row that are longer.\n\nIn particular, the Linux Nightly results look totally fine to me. There's only a single slightly longer CC. The OSX beta result also looks fine to me. We get 2 or 3 CCs in a row for a process, but then the times return to normal. The beta Windows looks a little less good, because the CC time goes up to around 200ms for 5 or 6 CCs in a row, but it does eventually drop down again.\n\nThe Linux beta result does look a little problematic, where the total time is very long (2000ms), and it is persisting for 3 CCs in a row. Is there a way to see more context? I only see those 3 CCs for that process. Again, if the times are much shorter before and after that, I think it isn't too bad.\n\nAs seen in comment 16, the big problem here was when we had long total CC times on every CC.", "author": "continuation@gmail.com", "id": 13279272, "time": "2018-05-15T17:31:04Z"}, {"text": "Added this to Firefox and ESR 60.0.1 release notes", "author": "rkothari@mozilla.com", "id": 13279492, "time": "2018-05-15T18:46:36Z"}, {"text": "I can no longer reproduce the bug on Firefox nightly (62.0a1 - 2018-05-15).
