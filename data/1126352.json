This could be \"html5sec.org/copypaste\" ... or Gmail.\n\nI copy the string \"Hello\" from the attached document. I paste it into an editable area. I do this very elegantly using Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C and then Ctrl-V. \n\nThen I click the resulting black SVG rectangle and an alert pops up.\n\n\nActual results:\n\nInjected HTML from within the font-names of the fonts used in the ODT make it into the editable area, bypassing FF's sanitizer from cross-origin / cross-application rich-text transfer.\n\nThe actual payload looks like this, you will find the source of it inside the ODT in a file called styles.xml.\n\n<div contenteditable=\"false\"><svg><a xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"?\"><circle r=\"4000\"></circle><animate attributeName=\"xlink:href\" begin=\"0\" from=\"javascript:alert(document.domain)\" to=\"&amp;\"></animate></a></svg></div>\n\nNote: This only works cross-application, not cross-origin. It has to come from an ODT. Or PDF - or anything else where I can inject nasty font-names.\n\n\nExpected results:\n\nNo XSS. The sanitizer should detect and mitigate it just as it does for cross-origin copy&paste.\n\nNote: The attached ODT works fine with copy&paste on Linux (Ubuntu, Gnome).
