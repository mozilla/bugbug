## Contributing

Discussions happen in #bugbug on irc.mozilla.org.

1. [Issues marked as `good-first-bug`](https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/labels/good-first-bug) are self-contained enough that a contributor should be able to work on them.
2. Issues are considered not assigned, until there is a PR linked to them. Feel free to work on any unassigned issue, you don't need to ask first.
