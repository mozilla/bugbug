## Contributing

Chat with us in the [bugbug](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#bugbug:mozilla.org) Matrix room.

1. [Issues marked as `good-first-bug`](https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/labels/good-first-bug) are self-contained enough that a contributor should be able to work on them.
2. Issues are considered not assigned, until there is a PR linked to them. Feel free to work on any unassigned issue, you don't need to ask first.
3. If you have any problem, it could be already answered in [Discussions](https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/discussions), if not, feel free to start a new discussion in the [Q&A](https://github.com/mozilla/bugbug/discussions/categories/q-a) category.
